# &#9924; Advent of Code 2023 &#9924;
Welcome to my repository for solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, implemented in Python. In this repository, you'll find my solutions for each day's puzzle, along with explanations and any relevant notes.
## Structure &#128208;
The repository is structured by day. Each day's problem set has its directory, named according to the convention `day_x`. Each directory has three files:
+ the input file `input.txt`
+ the solution to the first part `solutionA.py`
+ the solution to the second part `solutionB.py`
  
For easier access to the code files, I have provided a table of contents:

|Aoc Page                                               |Directory                         |Source files                                                                              |

## Running the code &#9881;
To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the `solutionA.py` or `solutionB.py` script. Make sure you have Python3 installed on your system. For example, to execute the solution from day 1:
```bash
cd advent-of-code-2023/day_one
python3 solutionA.py
```
The script will always run on the input file named `input.txt`, placed inside the same folder.
